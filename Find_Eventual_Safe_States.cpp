// Problem Statement: A directed graph of V vertices and E edges is given in the form of an adjacency list adj. Each node of the graph is labeled with a distinct integer in the range 0 to V â€“ 1. A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node. You have to return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

// Example 1:

// Input Format: N = 7, E = 7



// Result: {2 4 5 6}


// Explanation: Here terminal nodes are 5 and 6 as they have no outgoing edges.


// From node 0: two paths are there 0->2->5 and 0->1->3->0. 
// The second path does not end at a terminal node. So it is not 
// a safe node.
// From node 1: two paths exist: 1->3->0->1 and 1->2->5.
// But the first one does not end at a terminal node. So it is not a safe node.


// From node 2: only one path: 2->5 and 5 is a terminal node.
// So it is a safe node.


// From node 3: two paths: 3->0->1->3 and 3->0->2->5 
// but the first path does not end at a terminal node. 
// So it is not a safe node.


// From node 4: Only one path: 4->5 and 5 is a terminal node. 
// So it is also a safe node.


// From node 5: It is a terminal node. 
// So it is a safe node as well.


// From node 6: It is a terminal node. 
// So it is a safe node as well.


// Example 2:

// Input Format: N = 4, E = 4



// Result: {3}


// Explanation: Node 3 itself is a terminal node and it 
// is a safe node as well. But all the paths 
// from other nodes do not lead to a terminal node. So they are 
// excluded from the answer.
